#  Smart Crop Analytics System

A web-based data analysis application built with **Django** that allows users to explore Canadian agricultural data.
The system provides insights into crop production and yield trends through **interactive charts and dynamic filtering**.

---

# Features includes:

## Interactive Charts (Chart.js)

* Production by Crop
* Yield Over Time
* Production by Region

## Dynamic Filtering

* Filter by year
* Filter by region
* Search crops or regions
* Sort results

## Database Storage

* Uses **SQLite** (no external setup required)
* Data is **preloaded into the database**
* No CSV upload required (per project requirements)

## Data Analysis

* Aggregations using Django ORM (`Sum`, `Avg`)
* Charts update dynamically based on filters

---

#  Key Questions & How Charts Answer Them

This application is designed to answer specific analytical questions.

---

##  Chart 1: Production by Crop

**Questions:**

* Which crops have the highest production in Canada?
* How does production compare across crops?

**Explanation:**

* Displays total production per crop
* Higher bars = higher production
* Helps identify dominant crops

---

##  Chart 2: Yield Over Time

**Questions:**

* How has crop yield changed over time?
* Are there improvements in agricultural productivity?

**Explanation:**

* Shows average yield per year
* X-axis = Year
* Y-axis = Yield
* Reveals trends over time

---

##  Chart 3: Production by Region

**Questions:**

* Which regions produce the most crops?
* How does production vary by province?

**Explanation:**

* Compares production across regions
* Helps identify high-producing areas

---

## Supporting Features (Filters & Table)

**Questions:**

* What happens when filtering by year or region?
* How can users explore specific crops?

**Explanation:**

* Filters refine the dataset
* Charts update automatically
* Table shows detailed records

# How to Use the App

## Filters

* Select year
* Select region
* Enter search text
* Click **Filter**

 Charts update automatically

---

## Charts Overview

| Chart                | Description                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Production by Crop   | Total production per crop  |
| Yield Over Time      | Average yield per year     |
| Production by Region | Total production by region |

---

##  Table

* Displays filtered crop data
* Limited to improve performance
* Updates dynamically

---

# How Data Works

* Data stored in **SQLite (`db.sqlite3`)**
* Originally processed from CSV
* Managed using Django ORM:

  * `Sum()` → Production
  * `Avg()` → Yield

---

# Troubleshooting

## Charts not showing

Ensure Chart.js is included:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js"></script>
```

---

## Server not starting

Make sure you're in the correct folder:

```bash
cd crop_project
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## Data not appearing

If needed (optional):

```bash
python manage.py shell
exec(open('import_data.py').read())
```
